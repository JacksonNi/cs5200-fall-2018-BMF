This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the react-client for our final project. Since we are all beginners to front-end things, like react and javascript, this is just a very basic front-end app which designed for meeting the project requirement.

For using our app, please follow the instruction below.

## Set Up React Client From Your Environment

Clone app file /react-client from our team github repo.

In the app root directory, first install project:

## `npm install`

Then you can start this react app by:

## `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
