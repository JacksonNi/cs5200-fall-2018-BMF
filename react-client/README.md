This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the front-end part of our final project with react. Since we are all beginners to front-end things, this part is quite simple and ugly with very limited functions that only provide all requirements specified. However, we do provide a powerful API service for this project, where you could find from our API document.

## Available Scripts

First, clone folder react-client from our project's github repo to your local environment.

Then, At root directory, set up react environment by running:

#### `npm install`

Start react app by running:

#### `npm start`
